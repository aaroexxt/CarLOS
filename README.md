# CarOS
This repo holds the scripts behind my future car computer, CarOS. I am planning to build a computer inside of my car, and run this program on it, which will let me interface with the CAN bus eventually. This project is basically a frontend/backend nodejs server, which can do facial recognition to recognize me, play music, listen to voice commands, and more.
