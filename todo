reverse proxy cache
load balancing

colors in console w/overriding prototype

better 404 page

implement track type handling (client vs python)

Finish CLEANING UP cosserver.JS:
    - clean up init process (initweb and initpython functions)
    - add allemit and allon to socketUtils
    - 


music:

server onstartup looks for cache file, if it finds it it sends it to server
else it requests it and saves the results

changescuser now has to go to server

retry button on client side


DONE stuff:

also ability to switch soundcloud users DONE
shuffle/notshuffle button DONE
caching of soundcloud pages for low internet access DONE
err loading track display DONE
also dynamic hiding/showing of music menu DONE
