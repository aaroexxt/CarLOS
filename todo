M: use cubic or quintic function to describe zoom for map (linear is bad)
M: implement smart/nonsmart command matching
m: implement said commands so that commands aren't said twice
M: console of active users

CHARTJS STATS PAGE LIKE IN TESLA
odometer
music waveform dynamic movement when music plays


geographic tracking w/upload to ext domain
advanced panel of "A" menu which allows you to refresh soundcloud cache
sync settings with settings from "A" menu, use switchery.js for settings
menu doesnt dissapear (music), just moves in to side and on mouseover it plays animation and extends

and ofc...
a actual routing/geofinder algorithm
someday lol

and also ofc...
macchina code (when it arrives it is still "processing" as of 7/27/2018)
yeet 7/31 it is shipped and on the way
arrived aug 1

BIG CHANGE: stream soundcloud on nodejs side with option to switch to client side

playlist support

cache neural network weights for more efficient starting of server(brain.js toFunction)

reverse proxy cache
username cache

load balancing

better favicon (the a is lame)



use external sound card on rpi with audio device set inside of speaker({}) instance?

spam filtering which blocks clients sending > 1 request per 0.1 seconds

linux-like loading (LSB loading... etc (aesthetic))

search tracks sc

add rds/rdbs radio messages for radio through arduino

BIG CHANGE: remove socket.io and only use get/post requests

sc user which has only goodtracks
apple music
bluetooth

video playback

MAJ REQUIRED FEATURES BEFORE RELEASE:
    -Navigation with turn-by-turn directions
    -Working directions (chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=Developer%20FAQ%20-%20OpenStreetMap%20Wiki&uri=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ) and (chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=Google%20Maps%20Example%20-%20OpenStreetMap%20Wiki&uri=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Maps_Example)
    -FM Broadcasting
    -Legacy mode with python NOPE
    -Piezo status info
    -Bluetooth audio
    -Xbee working
    -Oled on RPI to give status DONE
    -do opencv processing inside of nodejs server instead of inside python file (REQUIRED for rpi) DONE


retry button on client side



COOL FRAMEWORKS TO IMPLEMENT:
progressbar.js for nice loading bar when client loads and for tracks
robot.js for control of rpi https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs
canvas gages for realtime sensor data? https://canvas-gauges.com/documentation/examples/


put frame data on image opencv

node-festival for speech generation, or tacotron?

chartjs accelerometer data, "blackbox" data
https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/updates.html
http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/



constantly scan for invalid authkeys to prevent tampering


DONE stuff:

arduino sensor overloading & gps handling DONE
electron framework? CANCELED
data logging DONE
state machine CANCELED
GPS+MAGNETOMETER EXT from arduino DONE
also ability to switch soundcloud users DONE
shuffle/notshuffle button DONE
caching of soundcloud pages for low internet access DONE
err loading track display DONE
also dynamic hiding/showing of music menu DONE
config nodemon to not restart when i modify globals.js DONE
colors in console w/overriding prototype DONE
use nodejs lib for progress bars in console DONE
Finish CLEANING UP cosserver.JS: DONE
    - clean up init process (initweb and initpython functions) KINDA-DONE
    - add allemit and allon to socketUtils DONE
    - 
music:

server onstartup looks for cache file, if it finds it it sends it to server DONE
else it requests it and saves the results DONE
once tracks are loaded, it loads the tracks into mp3 files DONE
better 404 page DONE (slightly)
FIX BUG WITH LOOP & TRACKS NOT WRAPPING DONE
use a timed listener to get song playing length on client side instead of bytes through decoder DONE
changescuser now has to go to server DONE

finish fixing cleaning directories (ESSENTIAL) DONE

cosserver wrapper that is like a watchdog - pings it every few seconds and checks if it is ok, then kills it if its not DONE

update script that automatically updates (clones into new folder, compares modified date or length and replaces files) DONE

time since forward or backward button pressed to prevent crashing DONE

implement track type handling (client vs python) UNNEEDED, python is gone now

loglevels for console.log, warn and error DONE


Portable ideas:
'black box' under seat
lithio battery under seat
